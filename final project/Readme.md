## Baseball Game Simulator

note:	Final project for the Probabilistic Programming Praktikum class.
	  
	  	I used the 2015 MLB data to generate the probabilities of the
	  	individual events happening during an at-bat. The batting and league
	  	files are from FanGraphs, and the pitching file is from Baseball 
	  	Reference. I made a few changes on the files, using Excel:

		  	On the Baseball Reference Pitching file, I removed the repeated 
			rows that specify the categories and the columns for the "rank" and 
			"plate appearances for which data is not known" categories.

		  	On the Baseball Reference file, I added a "1B" column for singles.

		  	On all three files, I added "BO" columns for "batted ball outs", 
		  	whose values are generated by "BO = PA - (H + SO + BB + IBB + HBP)."
		  	Therefore, SF, SH, and GDP are all included in this statistic, for
		  	now. I also added "TW" columns for "total walks," which sum up
		  	BB, IBB, and HBP.

		  	"Enrique Hernandez" was spelled "Kike Hernandez" without the accent 
		  	mark

## Things to be implemented in the future:
	Things that I might be able to implement are pitcher management and more
	accurate baserunning statistics.

	As listed on the articles below, there are a lot of things to consider in
	order to improve a single game baseball simulator.

## Questions:
	Features like Apply, Select, and Constant lift the Scala variables to
	probabilistic Figaro Elements. Is there a way to convert (or cast) a
	Figaro element back to a Scala variable?
