## Baseball Game Simulator

note:	Final project for the Probabilistic Programming Praktikum class.
	  
	  	The batting and league files are from FanGraphs, and the pitching file 
	  	is from Baseball Reference. I made a few changes on the files:
	  	- On the Baseball Reference Pitching file, I removed the repeated 
		rows that specify the categories and the columns for the "rank" and 
		"plate appearances for which data is not known" categories.
	  	- On the Baseball Reference file, I added a "1B" column for singles.
	  	- On all three files, I added "NO" columns for "normal outs", whose
	  	values are generated by "NO = PA - (H + SO + BB + IBB + HBP + SH + SF 
	  	+ ROE + GDP) (and the same formula without ROE on the FanGraphs 
	  	files)," because it is the only event that happens at the plate 
	  	and is not included in the charts.
