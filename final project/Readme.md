## Baseball Game Simulator

Title: README.md

Name: Jun Soo Shin

Date: 2 August 2016

purpose: Final project for the Probabilistic Programming Praktikum class.

## Notes:
- In order to limit the number of different scenarios, it is currently 
simulating a very specific situation: bottom 9th inning, tied game, home team 
batting with bases loaded and 1 out. There is also no extra inning. Also, 
normally, if a home team won a game, it would end with a difference of one run,
unless the game-ending play was multi-run home run. Right now, the program lets
the home team score as many runs as possible on the last play.
	  
- I used the 2015 MLB data to generate the probabilities of the
individual events happening during an at-bat. The batting and league
files are from FanGraphs, and the pitching file is from Baseball 
Reference. I made a few changes on the files, using Excel:

- On the Baseball Reference Pitching file, I removed the repeated 
rows that specify the categories and the columns for the "rank" and 
"plate appearances for which data is not known" categories.

- On the Baseball Reference file, I added a "1B" column for singles.

- On all three files, I added "BO" columns for "batted ball outs", 
whose values are generated by "BO = PA - (H + SO + BB + IBB + HBP)."
Therefore, SF, SH, and GDP are all included in this statistic, for
now. I also added "TW" columns for "total walks," which sum up
BB, IBB, and HBP.

- "Enrique Hernandez" was spelled "Kike Hernandez" without the accent 
mark.

## Things to be implemented in the future:
Things that I might be able to implement are pitcher management and more
accurate baserunning statistics.

As listed on the articles below, there are a lot of things to consider in
order to improve a single game baseball simulator.
