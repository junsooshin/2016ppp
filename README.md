# Probabilistic Programming Praktikum
2016 Summer Semester, University of TÃ¼bingen

## Brief Introduction
The course was designed for students to practice probabilistic programming
in Figaro programming language. Every two weeks I chose certain exercises in
the textbook as homework.

The final project is where I tried everything I had learned from the course.
The project was to build a simulator that predicts the outcome and stat lines
of individual players, given two lineups of baseball players. I could not quite 
finish the project, but I am planning on finishing it, perhaps by using Python.
